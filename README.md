This project is a micro-services based e-learning marketplace built using Spring Boot and Angular JS. It provides a platform for users to discover, purchase, and access online courses from various educational providers.

The project utilizes a microservices architecture to enhance scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. Each service handles a specific function, such as user management, course catalog, payment processing, and content delivery. This modular approach allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual components.

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
Course Discovery: Users can search for courses based on various criteria, such as topic, instructor, and price.
Course Purchase: Users can purchase courses using secure payment methods.
Course Access: Purchased courses can be accessed through the platform.
